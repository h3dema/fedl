# Federated Learning with PyTorch and Flower


## Run the project

This example might run faster when the `ClientApp`s have access to a GPU.
If your system has one, you can make use of it by configuring the `DEVICE` in `config.py`.


```bash
python3 simulation.py
```

You can change the configuration in []`config.py`](config.py).
